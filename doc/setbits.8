.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Sets a GPIO line (single bit) specified by \fIBN\fR to the value \fI\-s 0|1\fR
via the Linux kernel's gpiolib interface in sysfs.
.PP
The Atmel AT91 family (including the SAMA5 family) name each GPIO line as
follows: P<letter><num> where <letter> starts with 'A' and continues
to 'C', 'D' or 'E' depending on the SoC. And <num> is a number starting
at 0 up to 31, with the maximum value sometimes less than 31 depending on
the SoC. So examples include: PA0, PB31, PD5 and PE31.
.PP
GPIO lines can have many controls and be multiplexed with input and output
lines of other macrocells in a SoC. The Linux kernel provides the gpiolib
subsystem to hide individual SoC GPIO complexity and provide general
functionality. A relatively simple sysfs interface is provided by gpiolib
under the /sys/class/gpio directory. The interface is described
in <kernel_src>/Documentation/gpio.txt in the section titled: "Sysfs
Interface for Userspace (OPTIONAL)".
.PP
A GPIO line can be specified in one of three ways to this utility:
.TP
\fI\-b BN\fR only
Use the manufacturer's name (Atmel in this case) for the \fI\-b BN\fR option.
The letters can be in upper or lower case and the leading 'P' can be omitted.
Examples: '\-b PA5', '\-b pa5', '\-b a5' and '\-b PC31' .
.TP
\fI\-b BN\fR plus \fI\-p PORT\fR
In this form the bank letter is given to \fI\-p PORT\fR (e.g. '\-p B') and
the GPIO line number within that bank is given to
\fI\-b BN\fR (e.g. '\-b 5') . Combining these examples PB5 is the specified
GPIO line.
.TP
\fI\-p PORT\fR where \fIPORT\fR is a number
In this form the number given to \fI\-p PORT\fR (e.g. '\-p 35')
is a kernel GPIO number. Kernel GPIO numbers can be considered as a Linux
kernel experiment that failed in the case of Atmel SoCs. Worse, the
mapping between kernel GPIO numbers and Atmel GPIO naming has changed.
Best to avoid this form.
.PP
Since this utility uses a generic interface within the Linux kernel, it
should work with any processors that have GPIOs. The user's challenge is
to work out how that processor's GPIO naming conventions map to the
Linux kernel's GPIO numbers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIBN\fR
where \fIBN\fR either starts with a letter and is the manufacturer's GPIO
name (Atmel in this case) or it starts with a number. In the letter case
a leading 'P' is assumed if not given. The letter can be in upper or lower
case and must be followed by a number; examples: '\-b PA3', '\-b a3'
and '\-b PC31'. In the case where a number is given first (e.g. '\-b 3')
then that number is assumed to be the GPIO line within the bank
specified by the accompanying \fI\-p PORT\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
print out usage message then exit.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIPORT\fR
if \fIPORT\fR  is a letter then it is assumed to be a PIO bank. For example
if \fIPORT\fR is 'B' or 'b' then that is Atmel PIO bank 'PB'. In this case
the \fI\-b BN\fR option is also expected where \fIBN\fR is a number, for
example '\-b 3'. Together these examples would specify PIO line PB3.
If \fIPORT\fR is a number then it is interpreted as a Linux kernel GPIO
number. Prior to the lk 3.4 series PA0 mapped to the kernel GPIO number of
32; thereafter is mapped to 0 . If practice, kernel GPIO numbers should
be avoided.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fI0|1\fR
sets the GPIO line (single bit) specified by the \fI\-b BN\fR and/or
\fI\-p PORT\fR options to the value 0 or 1. If this option is not
given (and \fI\-S 0|1\fR is not given) then the given GPIO line is placed
in input mode and perhaps an internal or external pull-up will make it
appear high.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fI0|1\fR
same action as \fI\-s 0|1\fR .
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
this option causes the specified GPIO line to be "unexported" prior to other
operations by this utility. This may be required if the specified GPIO line
was left in the "exported" state (e.g. a previous incantation of this utility
used the \fI\-U\fR option). If this operation fails then an error message is
output and the utility continues. See the kernel documentation file (gpio.txt)
for more information about exported and unexported states. At boot up
typically all available GPIO lines are in the "unexported" state.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR
this option causes the specified GPIO line to be left "exported" when this
utility exits. The default action is to "unexport" the specified GPIO line
prior to this utility exiting.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output). Additional output
caused by this option is sent to stderr.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
print the version string and then exit.
.SH NOTES
Atmel generic GPIO lines may be multiplexed with other functions. Examples
of these other functions include GPIO lines used for serial ports (e.g. TXD,
RXD and RTS), I2C, SPI, 100_Mbps_ethernet and interrupt lines. The readbits
utility should be used with care since if the given GPIO line is "in use"
then after an invocation of setbits is finished then that GPIO line will be
left in generic mode as an output. That may cause the previous function that
the GPIO line was being used for to fail. Some versions of the Linux kernel
prohibit utilities like setbits touching reserved GPIO lines. However in
recent kernels (which have recently introduced "Device Tree" (open firmware)
configuration) everything seems to be allowed. That may (and should) change
to impose restrictions on other utilities interfering with reserved GPIO
lines.
.SH EXAMPLES
First check if some GPIO lines are in use:
.PP
   a5d2_pio_status \-S
.br
       PIN   PIO_A        PIO_B        PIO_C        PIO_D        PIO_E
.br
       0:    GPIO         GTX0         ETX0         MCI0_CDA     A0/NBS0
.br
       .....
.br
       31:   GPIO         DTXD         GPIO         GPIO         GPIO
.PP
This indicates the PB31 is being used for the debug serial port TXD line
and the other GPIO lines are "free". It is possible that some of those other
GPIO lines are in use, for example driving small LEDs or reading the
state of a switch. So more checking may be warranted. Let us assume PA31
is free:
.PP
   setbits \-b pa31 \-s 1
.br
   readbits \-b pa31
.br
     1
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of setbits is 0 when it is successful. If setbits fails then
the exit status is most likely to be 1.
